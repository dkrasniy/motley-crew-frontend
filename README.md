# Motley Crew

Document Routing and Approval Application

## Description

Our application will handle routing, reviewing and digitally signing documents and pdfs.  The goal was to create a seamless process of signing and finalizing documents, in a way that fits the specific needs of our client. Features of the software include creating signature profiles, uploading scanned PDF or word documents, linear or parallel routing, an interface for identifying signature and date areas on documents.

- The backend is found in a separate repo [here](https://github.com/maxshay/motley-crew-django-backend).
